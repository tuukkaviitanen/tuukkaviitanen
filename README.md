### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineering Student / Junior Software Developer from Finland with a burning passion for coding. ❤️‍🔥

My experience is mainly from C# and JavaScript/TypeScript web projects, but I'm always excited to learn new languages and technologies.

I enjoy learning to utilize new tools and reflecting about my experiences with them. I put a lot of work in my README files, so I would be ecstatic if you found the time to read some of them through, and maybe even try out the projects! I happily welcome any ideas or feedback, so feel free to open issues on any of the repositories! 😊

I can't wait to create new stuff and try out new technologies in my future projects. You can follow my work here! 🚀
