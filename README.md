### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineering Student / Junior Software Developer from Finland with a burning passion for software development.❤️‍🔥

Most of my work experience is in C#/.NET with ASP.NET Core and Xamarin/.NET MAUI projects. I am also higly interested in Full Stack development with JavaScript/TypeScript and have been studying it intensely. 

I'm currently building a personal project using React.js and Node.js, utilizing many Full Stack technologies. You can find it in my pinned repositories as `messenger`. I have written a thorough documentation about it in the readme-file, so you can find out more about it there! I enjoy learning new technologies and reflecting about my experiences with them. I would be ecstatic if you found the time to read it through and try out the website, as I have put a lot of work into it! I happily welcome any ideas or feedback, so feel free to open an issue on the repository!😊

I can't wait to test out new technologies on my future projects. You can follow my work here!
